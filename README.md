#Simple Github Webapp
You're going to build a simple webapp to display user's data

##Requirements
1. **You must use [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/)** as your front end framework. 
2. The webapp must take a github username as input, and display the user's count of followers, count of users he/she is following, count of repo, and the list of repo **using [github's public API](https://developer.github.com/v3/)**. Note that this project can done entirely on the frontend.
3. Must be deployed and accessible on the cloud (heroku, github pages, etc)

Here's an example of finished project

##What we're looking for
1. Good docmentation - comments, etc
2. Logic, coding style, structure, and orgization of your code
3. Ability to deploy an actual project

Don't worry too much about html/css styling. We're just looking at your general software engineering skills, not your design skills.
This should take no more than 2 - 3 hours of your time. This is not meant to be a time consuming project, and if it's taking too long then there might be something wrong with your approach.

##Submission
1. Create a repo with the code needed to run your app
2. Send the link to your github repo and deployed site to ben@fastwork.co

Have fun, and let me know if you have any questions.
